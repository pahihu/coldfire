1) History of The Coldfire Emulator (written by Austin, editted slightly
	by me.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Coldfire Emulator is a Motorola Coldfire 5206 Emulator.  It's
original beginnings date back to the fourth term (2nd year) of the
University of Waterloo's Computer Engineering program (summer of 1999). 
The Electrical and Computer Engineering (E&CE) 222 course - Digital 
Computers - taught Motorola Coldfire 5206 assembly as an introduction to 
machine assembly language.  Since the Computer Engineering class of 2002 is
twice the size of previous classes, the demand for Coldfire boards was much
greater than their availability.  (Also the fact that several classmates 
apparently didn't understand "NO food or drinks in the labs" and kept getting
the labs deadbolted on us didn't help).  Thus, David Grant began his emulator
project to work on labs without requiring the actual hardware boards.
Although the emulator progressed far enough to be used for the first three
labs, interrupts were not yet implemented so the real boards were used for
the final assignment.  The next term featured the course E&CE 354 - Real-Time 
Operating Systems - where a project involved writing a real-time executive 
(RTX) for the Motorola Coldfire 5206 platform. (Insert same problems with
availability and stupid classmates here). So, the emulator was dusted off
and developed in parallel with the RTX.

   Special thanks to Austin, Kris, and Tennille (in order of 
alphabeticalness) for putting up with me sometimes developing the emulator
over our project :)

   In March, 2000, Dave released his emulator to the general public under
the GPL, in the hope that it will be useful to other people... In particular
to the E&CE department, and potentially save many future generations of
electrical and computer engineers from stuffy overcrowded Coldfire labs. :)

   The emulator currently features all but 5 assembly instructions, a full
dBug (rip off of Motorola's dBUG) with extra functionality, both serial
ports, the parallel port, interrupts (through telnet sessions), full
exception handling, timers and timer interrupts, and full tracing capability.

2) Emulator Requirements 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Well, it used to need PThreads, but it doesn't anymore.
   It builds nicely on just about every Linux flavour I've come across. 
   It build on Windows using the Cygwin compiler.


3) How To Use dBug
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire up the Coldfire and type 'help'.  :)
